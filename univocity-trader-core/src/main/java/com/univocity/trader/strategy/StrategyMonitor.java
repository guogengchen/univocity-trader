/**
 * Class responsible for monitoring trades made by a {@link Trader}, after a {@link Strategy} returns a {@link Signal}.
 * It can contain {@link Indicator}s to help deciding what to do on every tick received from the
 * {@link com.univocity.trader.Exchange}. Once a {@code BUY} is received, and no position is open,
 * {@link #discardBuy(Strategy)} will be invoked to confirm if it is a good time to buy. If it is, a position is open
 * and {@link #bought(Trade, Order)} will be called. After that, {@link #handleStop(Trade, Signal, Strategy)} will be
 * invoked after every tick received from the exchange, to allow closing the {@link Trade}.
 *
 * If {@link #handleStop(Trade, Signal, Strategy)} returns a not {@code null} value or a {@code SELL} signal is
 * received'
 * from the {@link Strategy}, {@link #allowExit(Trade)} will be invoked to confirm whether to exit the trade. If the
 * trade is closed, {@link #sold(Trade, Order)} will be invoked. During the lifetime of the trade, a few other methods
 * might be invoked:
 *
 * - {@link #highestProfit(Trade, double)} when a winning trade reaches a new high positive rate of return.
 * - {@link #worstLoss(Trade, double)} when a losing trade is reaches a new low negative rate of return.
 * - {@link #allowTradeSwitch(Trade, String, Candle, String)} when there are no funds available to trade anymore and
 * a {@link Strategy} finds a buying opportunity, this method will be called to ask if the current trade can be exited
 * to release funds and open another trade in another instrument. Specific details about the trade can be obtained from
 * the {@link Trader} instance.
